# Scala.js cross compile example

This is an example on how to cross compile code to Scala.js and Scala JVM.

To try it out, launch sbt and type:

    sbt> fooJS/run
    sbt> fooJVM/run

More information can be found in the
[Scala.js documentation](http://www.scala-js.org/doc/sbt/cross-building.html).
